# Resource-efficient-fine-tuning-techniques
NLP and ML have undergone a transformation in how models are trained. With the rise of pretrained models, fine-tuning for downstream tasks has become the go-to approach. Now, we’re diving deeper into instruction tuning—a powerful method that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by making them more adaptable and useful
